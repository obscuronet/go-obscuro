<h2>Decrypt rollup transactions retrieved from the L1</h2>

<p>These could be transactions retrieved via <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>, for example.</p>

<p>
    Note that decrypting rollups is only possible for testnet, as the key used to encrypt rollups is long-lived and
    well-known. Beyond testnet, enclaves will use rotating keys that are not known to anyone - or any thing - other
    than the Obscuro enclaves.
