Obscuro achieves privacy using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), specifically Intel’s SGX. This technology has been proven over the last decade to be a reliable means of ensuring privacy with full computational capabilities.  

Obscuro brings full privacy to the Ethereum Mainnet, leveraging the liveness and availability of the Mainnet for ledger integrity. Uniquely, Obscuro’s Proof of Block Inclusion (POBI) protocol ensures Obscuro's confidential roll-ups have consensus in the decentralized Obscuro network.
