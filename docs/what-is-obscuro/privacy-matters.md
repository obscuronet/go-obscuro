# Privacy Matters 

With $1.5 trillion of tokens on value locked on Ethereum today, it has proven to be the decentralized platform that can support real business transactions. Yet it has not been able to attract real-world assets.  

Privacy is the key feature holding back exponentially larger real-world assets that would greatly benefit from the decentralization and smart contracts Ethereum provides. This opportunity represents the next wave of growth for blockchain. Foreign exchange alone is $6 trillion of transactions daily, as an example. 

Existing Dapps, and users, would see immediate benefits from an L2 that brings privacy, unlocking new capabilities for Dapps with a new primitive. Privacy by default allows for a whole new category of capabilities for the DeFi, Games, NFT and other Dapps that drive most of the transactions on ledger today.
