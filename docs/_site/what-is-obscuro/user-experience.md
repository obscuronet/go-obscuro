# User Experience 

A delightful user experience is a key consideration for Obscuro and design decisions intentionally treat this is as a higher priority. This means Ethereum apps can move over to Obscuro without changes and all Dapps can execute unmodified EVM code and operate their same client applications. End-users can continue to use existing wallets. The goal has been to build Obscuro so interacting with an Obscuro application is the same as interacting with any Ethereum application on an L2 with the benefit of full computational privacy.
