 - publish the hash of the shared secret  to the L1, and also added to the haeder of the rollup?
 - hardcode the address of the management smart contract and each enclave can decide what to do when it ingests the blocks

2. How to make the secret sharing more efficient?
 - currently the requester submits a transaction to the L1, and everybody responds automatically. Which is super inefficient.
 - need to find a way where only someone responds. If they don't respond, then the next,etc
 - based on the request, there should be a way to uniquely calculate who should respond
