// This test creates a network of in memory L1 and L2 nodes, then injects transactions, and finally checks the resulting output blockchain.
// Running it long enough with various parameters will test many corner cases without having to explicitly write individual tests for them.
// The unit of time is the "AvgBlockDuration" - which is the average time between L1 blocks, which are the carriers of rollups.
// Everything else is reported to this value. This number has to be adjusted in conjunction with the number of nodes. If it's too low,
// the CPU usage will be very high during the simulation which might result in inconclusive results.
