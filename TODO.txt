DONE

- T2: Introduce basic crypto for L2 transactions (Complexity level 4)
- T9: Implement p2p communication, gossiping between L2 nodes (Complexity level 3)
- T10: Implement the enclave service (Complexity level 3)
- Create a unit test with a checker for the final state of the simulation:
    - all injected transactions were included, and there are no duplicates
    - the state in each rollup matches the transactions (deposits + L1)
    - L1 height, L2 height, how many reorgs, etc - if the efficiency is below a threshold then something could have happened
- in simulation, add checks around validly and invalidly signed transactions

TODO

Complex:

- T1: Bring in the core ethereum structures (see first task from route to testnet), and connect Obscuro to a real L1 node (Complexity level 3)
- T3: Introduce better mempool logic (Complexity level 4)
- T4: Refactor the Obscuro "database" and introduce something proper that works within an enclave (Depends on T6) (Complexity level 2)
- T5: Create better logic to get L2 node up to speed (Depends on T1) (Complexity level 3)
- T6: Replace the state and transaction execution with code from geth (Depends on T2) (super complex task) (Complexity level 1)
- T7: Refactoring create a Blockchain structure (see geth)- to better encapsulate the logic (Complexity level 5)
- T8: Implement the obscuro cryptography (Depends on T4) (Complexity level 2):
    - from the master seed derive the keys
    - create the transaction block

Normal:

- update the readme
- make publishing to L1 more random (to simulate aggregators failing to publish)
- use "gauge" instead of stats
- introduce event feeds
- collect statistics when multiple rollups compete (to see what actually happens)
- When verifying a rollup - check that the withdrawals in the header match the withdrawals as calculated
- add configuration file support

Future:
- analyse the POBI round - some inefficient state recalculation for the rollups
- analyse the impact of encrypting the entire obscuro transaction or leaving out some fields like the gas. The concern 
  is that a ddos attack can be peformed where someone creates lots of transactions with 0 gas without any personal cost, 
  but which will keep the network busy.
